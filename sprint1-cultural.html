                        <h1 class="blog-heading">Discuss your personal values</h1>
                        <p class="blog-text">I grew up rurally on a dairy farm in New Zealand. My parents were relatively easy going in terms of strictness and I admired how hard they worked on the farm. However, growing up I saw how much my parents would struggle with constant worry about paying for a mortgage, relying on things they can’t control that would specifically affect their income (the weather, animals etc.) and the burn out that long physical hours naturally takes on someone. The stress of always feeling like you can’t get ahead definitely was felt. I was the youngest in my family as well, and the only boy. It probably did give me a sense of feeling like I was hard done by, or that thing’s weren’t fair for me, because I was different. When I moved to Wellington and learned more about the world and other peoples perspectives, I gained a new appreciation for the working class beyond my parents. I never understood the huge wealth gaps there are in the world, and the benefits that some people receive in the world until I met people with true privilege. Nor could I understand why there seemed to be a welcome ignorance to this. These reasons are why I value Empathy and Curiousity so highly.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">Regarding empathy, I can’t understand why people actively suggest that there aren’t certain inequality issues in the world. It makes me believe that there are systems where people benefit from this and are actively ignoring this, or have been tricked by the people from higher positions that benefit. Using empathy, I do wish to make things more fair for everyone in the world in my own way.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">When it comes to curiosity, the idea of being wilfully ignorant is crazy to me. There is so much interesting information in the world we can learn and things to do and see. You're only on this world once and it’s a waste to not learn as much as we can and try to understand why we’re here and what life means in our own ways.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">Lastly, excitement is very important to me. Growing up on the farm, I couldn't go hang out with my friends after school, and so I was bored a lot. Further to this, so much of our lives revolve around such boring stuff. Some necessary, some not so much, like traffic, waiting rooms and so on. I think it’s so important to create some fun and fast paced excitement in any form that you can. Whether this be making a game of something mundane, or doing something completely out of character.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">However, there have been times where my trust in my values have been tested. Recently, when applying for a student allowance, I was tempted to not disclose the fact that I have money in shares as I knew it would affect my application. I weighed up the pros and cons and whether it was ethical and decided that although my personal belief is that people who go and study should be offered some benefit from the government (as I believe study is a beneficial investment that ultimately provides rewards to society), I didn’t think it was fair for others who wouldn’t be able to receive this benefit who are worse off than myself. Subsequently, rather than receiving an income during my study, I’ll pay for it myself, as I think it’s fair based on other people’s situations.</p>

                        <h1 class="blog-heading">Describe your strengths and weaknesses</h1>
                        <p class="blog-text">Being the youngest of four and the only boy, I was picked on a lot. My Mum believes this why I have such a great value for fairness. She said that if I didn't think someone was treated right, I would say something.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">In some ways, this can make me quite headstrong and stubborn. In terms of strengths there are some good things that come out of this. I rarely give up on things I begin and I'm always willing to fight for what I believe in. It also gives me the attitude that we can always solve something and helps me to think outside of the box. However, this can be detrimental, as sometimes whe I commit to a plan that doesn't work, I can spend too much time on it and overlook other options or paths in the meantime.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">In saying that, I think my tenacity and my curious mind will highly benefit my learning and overcome any issues that arise from this. As I'm learning these new skills, I think my sense of curiousity to try out new processes and tools, will far outweigh my stubborness to commit to certain plans. Also, I have been working on myself to not fall in to traps that stem from this since my last role in the UK.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">In my previous role, I found that in the UK there is a much stronger influence in bureaucracy and hierarchy in the workplace. This would frustrate me, as I just wanted to dig in get some work done and have my voice heard. With further reearch on values, I found that this type of mindset is common for ENFP (the campaigner) personality types. I tried using their channels to vent my frustrations of the system, but it still didn’t help. Looking back, I think I should've realised that it was worthwhile to play the game a little, especially if that was the type of work environment that runs like that. In the long run I could’ve moved in to other roles that allowed more freedom or go to a new company if the issues were unresolvable. What I can do though, is take this as a learning experience and move forward. </p>
