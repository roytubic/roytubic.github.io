                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">Emotional intelligence (otherwise known as emotional quotient or EQ) is the ability to understand, use, and manage your own emotions in positive ways to relieve stress, communicate effectively, empathize with others, overcome challenges and defuse conflict. It can be defined by four specific attributes:

                        <li class="blog-text">Self-management – You’re able to control impulsive feelings and behaviors, manage your emotions in healthy ways, take initiative, follow through on commitments, and adapt to changing circumstances.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="blog-text">Self-awareness – You recognize your own emotions and how they affect your thoughts and behavior. You know your strengths and weaknesses, and have self-confidence.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="blog-text">Social awareness – You have empathy. You can understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people, pick up on emotional cues, feel comfortable socially, and recognise the power dynamics in a group or organisation.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li class="blog-text">Relationship management – You know how to develop and maintain good relationships, communicate clearly, inspire and influence others, work well in a team, and manage conflict.</li>

                        <h1 class="blog-heading">How is it different to IQ?</h1>
                        <pr class="blog-text">IQ relates to academic prowess and relates to the ability to learn and understand and apply information to skills. People with higher IQ can think in abstracts and make connections by making generalizations easier. On the other hand, EQ relates to your emotion and how you can handle your motivations, stress and relationships with others. In a real basic form, you can use the common term, “book smarts vs street smarts”.</pr>

                        <h1 class="blog-heading">Why is Emotional Intelligence (EQ) important?</h1>
                        <pr class="blog-text">There are differing perspectives on whether EQ or IQ is more important. Some say that a high IQ will get you through school, a high EQ will get you through life. When working on a project or in the workplace in general, you need to be able to keep motivation up, avoid being overwhelmed and work well with others. It wouldn’t matter how smart you are if you’re too stressed out to work, or if you can’t work effectively in teams. For a long time, IQ was believed to be the ultimate measure for success in careers and life in general, but there are studies that show a direct relation between higher EQ and successful professionals. Though I would argue learning about EQ should be more than just about professional development, but also for your own enlightenment in all aspects of your life.</pr>
