                        Neuroplasticity, promotes the idea that no one is stuck with a predetermined level intelligence, and just like any muscle it can 
                        be improved and grow with training and practice. If you’re aware that your brain can always be moulded and that there are skills 
                        to create the pathways, then you’ll be less likely to think that you can’t improve yourself, or that you can’t learn new things. 
                        Information that seems too difficult becomes less daunting as you’re aware that the constant practice will improve the connections 
                        required to understand.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I can apply this by thinking about the skill even when not performing physically or literally. For example, I am learning Spanish 
                        on apps and via the internet. When I’m not able to study for this, I can practice talking in my brain in the sentences I already 
                        know in Spanish back and forth in order to strengthen my memory recall for this. It’s similar to how muscles work, the more you work 
                        it out, the stronger it becomes. However, rather than a muscle being ripped and repairing to be stronger (as a reaction to your 
                        environment that your body deems necessary) your brain creates these connections as it understand that creating paths to learn 
                        these skills as a reaction to the environment of constant thought of practice or learning.

                        There are many ways you can improve your relationship with Neuroplasticity, including the following practices:
                            <ul>-  Get enough sleep</ul>
                            <ul>-  Continue learning and keep moving</ul>
                            <ul>-  Reduce stress</ul>
                            <ul>-  Find a strong purpose for what you're planning to learn</ul>
                            <ul>-  Read a novel</ul>
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        I found this quote below online, and I feel like it provides a good explanation as to why neuroplasticity is important for 
                        survival: <i>“It refers to the physiological changes in the brain that happen as the result of our interactions with our environment. 
                        From the time the brain begins to develop in utero until the day we die, the connections among the cells in our brains reorganize 
                        in response to our changing needs. This dynamic process allows us to learn from and adapt to different experiences”</i> – Celeste Campbell (n.d.).

                <h1 class="blog-heading">Growth mindset</h1>

                        A growth mindset is the belief that you can improve and do better, rather than accepting your status quo and that you’ll be the same. 
                        It's the direct opposite of a fixed mindset, that suggests that everyone has a level of abilities, intelligence and talents and these
                        will remain as a fixed trait. IQ tests support this type of theory, where your measure is determined by a number and is a fixed trait.
                        
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        What I find surprising is that this does seem pretty obvious in theory, but I feel like it isn't used in practice. Schools still rely 
                        heavily on old fashioned grading and learning practices that don't seem to support the idea of a growth mindset. Also, when children
                        are complimented on their work, we usually use trait compliments like "you're so smart". I would suggest that this isn't the best way 
                        to go as it may give them the reliance on that they are just naturally gifted and won't push themselves to learn. In addition, it could 
                        stiffle their motivation if their intelligence is questioned via a failing grade or if proven wrong. There are skills that can be used to 
                        influence a growth mindset instead, such as rather having failing grades, you could have grades that say ‘nearly there’ to promote a sense 
                        of progress and would influence motivation. This is better than straight fail grades, as these have no progress implication and influence a 
                        mindset that you’ll never change.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Going forward with my implementation of a growth mindset, I'm going to focus on a reward system that focuses on progress rather than quality. 
                        So during this course, I’ll reward myself for reaching my hours that I’ve outlined for myself and for showing improvement in my knowledge, 
                        more so than the feedback on my actual projects. Not that feedback isn't important as well, I just beleive showing progress is better than
                        perfect results first time.

                        During my research I found this quote and I found it very helpful to my understanding of the growth mindset: <i>This growth mindset is based 
                        on the belief that your basic qualities are things you can cultivate through your efforts. Although people may differ in every which way — 
                        in their initial talents and aptitudes, interests, or temperaments — everyone can change and grow through application and experience.</i> You
