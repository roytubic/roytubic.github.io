                        I learned that it’s always good to reassess your views of your identity and values. In the past I’ve done quite a bit of 
                        self reflection to learn more about who I am as a person, but that was a while ago. Doing it this time, I found that some 
                        of my values had changed, not drastically, but it was important to note that I had changed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I learnt a lot about how I work when not prompted by classes or bosses or managers to motivate me, it was all under my own 
                        schedule. When I used to study in the past, I found it hard to fine time to focus and study as I felt under pressure by 
                        deadlines and assignments. I found being more autonomous let me choose when I wanted to study and I felt more motivated 
                        because of it.

                        Lastly I found neuroplasticity really interesting. I find myself taking on hobbies quite often where I give up because 
                        I don’t have the motivation to keep practicing, and just assume I don’t have the talent each time I try. Knowing that 
                        there are actual connections being made in my brain when I practice gives me more reassurance and trust in the idea 
                        of constant practice.

                        Values, empathy and self awareness are all important factors around emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is 
                        important to understand yourself and others. It's important to be an effective communicator, friend, colleague, student,
                        teacher, programmer and so on. A good knowledge of these principles means that you can understand and manage emotions in 
                        an effective and positive way. This can helpm reduce stress and anxiety, improve you empathy for others, improve relationships 
                        and avoid and defuse conflicts.

                        Definitely how much you learn about yourself. You always feel like you have a good idea of who are you as a person, but taking a 
                        good hard look always brings out new things. It’s like It’s also interesting to see how others think about you compared to yourself. 
                        I found that the values that I feel attached were not what others thought I’d put the highest, which was interesting. I reevaluated 
                        with this feedback to see if I felt they would change, but I found no change, so it was interesting to see how different others 
                        opinions and your own opinions of yourself are.

                        Getting effective feedback consistently from my friends and family. It was difficult get feedback that was constructive. I tried 
                        wording questions in a way to make it easier for my peers to provide constructive feedback, but it wasn’t fully understood. What 
                        I got back was mostly rebuttals of my opinions but without any argument (just a “no, but I don’t know why I think that” type of answer). 
                        However, I don’t blame them for this, the people I asked were friends and family who don’t partake in this type of learning, for 
                        their careers or other wise. I could’ve asked others who did have more knowledge on this, but I feel like they don’t know me well 
                        enough to provide accurate information, or they wouldn’t feel comfortable.

                        Web development is essentially creating a product or tool to be used by people. If you don’t understand how people think, how 
                        are you supposed to effectively create a tool for someone to understand and use? Beyond that, coding is often a transport. 
                        Creating code is a big job, and usually requires a team. If you can’t work with others effectively, this will halt progress 
                        on projects and cause more conflicts and unnecessary stress.
