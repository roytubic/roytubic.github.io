                        <pr class="blog-text">I’d like to say I think outside of the box quite well. I usually have a pretty pessimistic view, which normally would be a bad thing, I find it helps to find sources of potential improvement in projects that may normally get unnoticed. I’m also pretty good with my time management, I usually find that I don’t have many issues with getting my allocated work finished. This is usually because I get stuck in and I like to keep working until I get everything done. This can cause some issues though, as I keep working until I burn out and I may not plan as well as I should at times. This is what I'll need to focus on in my learning plan.</pr>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">I have regulated work times and made a hard rule that I won’t work over 2 and half hours without a break in order to prevent burn out. I’ve also scheduled in specific breaks which I must take, and half days that I’ll use for a co-curricular activity. In terms of jumping straight in to my work, I’m going to ensure that I brainstorm my work before I start for each assignment. I will delegate specific time for this, so if there’s an assignment which will take 2 hours, I’ll make 20 minutes of that be prep work, before I jump in.</pr>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">As I am working remotely though, I'll need to set up an effective support system. If I have some queries that aren’t urgent, I’ll note them down and come back to them later to narrow down specifically what I don’t understand, and talk to my cohort about them. If it is urgent, I’m going to utilise google to further understand my problem, use slack to ask the group to discuss or bring up in my meetings with teams in projects. Also, I’m going to try partner up with someone in the group who I can regularly go to discuss my thoughts.</pr>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">When it comes to support from the facilitation team, I don’t expect them to drop everything to help me at all times. All I expect is for them to provide some support when times both suit us to catch up and/or they provide good resources for me to use so that I can find the answers myself. Also, if they could help me with linking up with other students, as I won't be able to do this in person.</pr>

                        <h1 class="blog-heading">What do I expect to learn in the next few months?</h1>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">I’d like to learn more about working productively, while working remotely and still be able to contribute to team projects. I had some chances to do this in my past role, but a lot of it was one on one work. As I am studying remotely, I think I’ll have many chances to do so. I can use these skills for working with team members around the world and from home (skills that we've seen are necessary as a response to Covid). </pr>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">Taking this further, I believe that the skills that I'll learn in this course, can specifically relate to my end career goals. I’d like to use my future programming skills and business platform experience to create a new app that benefits small businesses. That or make some form of impact in the business platform industry. When I'm a bit older though, I’d like to work more remotely in my own business and spend more time with my family and have a more rural lifestyle. As I'm studying remotely, I think the skills that I'll utilise in the next few months will directly feed to how I'll work in the future.</pr>
