                        The other day, I was working on one of the challenges for this course and it was't working quite correctly. 
                        The problem was with the Mainpulating the DOM challenge as I couldn't get the invisible function in the challenge 
                        to work. I knew there was something wrong, so I tried over and over different code entries to get the fuction to work. 
                        When I attempted the challenge, there was pseudocode laid out to identify where everything should go. 
                        Psuedocode is fake code or comments that you use to identify where your real code will go and what it does. 
                        I tried to console.log, but I wasn't very good with it and couldn't create an effective test to check any error messsages 
                        at the time. Google was my next option, so I googled how to console.log this type of test, but couldn't quite understand 
                        why it didn't work. I also had tried referring to slack to see if anybody else had any issues. Eventually, I asked my 
                        facilitor Ed for some help and he pointed out that there were small typo errors in three lines of my code. Also, some 
                        of the typo errors wouldn't cause an error message. After discussing with Ed, I talked about this in my reflections 
                        to check further for typos like this when things aren't running correctly, rather than relying on an error message, 
                        or by googling. Because as there was nothing majorly wrong with my code, only small errors, any information I was  
                        getting via google and slack, seemed to match my answer (excluding the typos), so I wasn't learning.

                        At one point, I used to play a lot of sudoku, specifically the expert ones. Now, the expert ones always get to a point 
                        where you just get stuck and you can't find a way forward. When this would happen I always had a system I would follow. 
                        I would first type out every possible answer a space could have in a square. Once these were all laid out, usually I 
                        could knock off a few more answers. Further to this, quite often I would implemenet some rubber ducky strategies where 
                        I would talk to my phone as I was playing and saying "well this can go there, but that means this would go here". This  
                        often would help me to understand the information in front of me, and I could always knock off a few more. I've even gotten 
                        to the point where I have watched experts online to see what skills they implement on difficult sudoku problems. However, 
                        eventually, it would get to the point where there was no moves I could make and I couldn't use my logic to figure something 
                        out. At this point, I would try out certain solutions by erasing one possible answer from a square and see what possibile 
                        solutions it would create. Once I had tested the solution and felt confident, I'd lock it in and more often than not, I 
                        was correct.
