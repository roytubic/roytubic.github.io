                        <pr class="blog-text">When a website is opened, the browser will receive data from a server to load. Often this information will come back in the form of HMTL and CSS data. This data is code that the browser will then read In order to present a website.
                        </pr>

                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">Imagine you were a comic book writer and you need two people to help you make your comic book. The first one would be the illustrator, he’s the one who will take your story and draw all the scenes and characters on to the page. The other is the colourist, it’s the colourist’s job to take the scenes and characters and add colour to them. It’s also the colourists job to decid the shape of each panel for the best design.</pr>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">With reference to programming, the illustrator would be HTML. They do most of the building of the structure and holds the core information, but this structure will have a pretty basic flow and the information won’t be very pretty. The colourist is then comparable to CSS. CSS can be used to add colour and flare to the information presented in the HTML.</pr>

                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">Control flow is the order in which functions in program are made or executed. A control flow statement usually comes in the form of determining a path to take in the program and then moving on to the next statement via that selected path. For example if there is a prompt on a website that reads type B for a blue cartoon or G for a green cartoon, the code may have a function that runs an if and else if statement that determines which cartoon to play based on your choice. The will then define a path based on which statement is true.</pr>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">However, there are some mechanisms that can alter the control flow. One such function is a loop, which is a sequence of statements which is executed once, but carries out the same function multiple times in succession, rather than defining a new path. These loops can be executed a specified number of times or until a condition is met. </pr>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">For example, when watching the cartoon on your website, it may play repeatedly until you type STOP.  So the initial function could read Choose B or G to choose your cartoon, you make your choice, then it will play the cartoon. While the cartoon plays there is a small warning at the bottom of the screen saying type STOP to end the cartoon. Once STOP has been typed the function will now read as false and the loop function will end.</pr>

                        <pr class="blog-text">The Document Object Model (DOM) is an interface  that is applied in browser that will read an HTML document as a tree structure rather than code. The tree structure uses nodes, where in each node is an object representing a part of the document. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects, this being the information from the HTML file or required elements that may be missing from the HTML. These objects are the parts that come together to form the website.</pr>

                        <br>
                        <pr class="blog-text">When a browser loads a website, it creates a DOM in the background. Javascript  can be used to make changes to the nodes in the DOM, but this won’t change the original HTML source. </pr>

                        <br>
                        <p class="blog-text">Here are examples of the main types of nodes we’ll see in the DOM:
                            <ul class="blog-text">-  The Window node: This represents your browser, and will always be the first node in the DOM.</ul>
                            <ul class="blog-text">-  The document node: This represents the page and branching  can begin after this node.</ul>
                            <ul class="blog-text">-  Element nodes: These nodes are the objects that represent the sections in our HTML file (such as body, headings, paragraphs etc.)</ul>
                            <ul class="blog-text">-  Attribute nodes: These are the tags used in the element nodes such as classes and ID’s.</ul>
                            <ul class="blog-text">-  Text nodes: These nodes represent the text written in the elements in the HTML file.</ul>
